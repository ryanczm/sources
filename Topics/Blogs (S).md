# Overview

Blogs allow for exposure to different areas of complexity - allowing one to see how a master of a craft perceives their world/reality.

The idea is to bookmark and structure these blogs, then visit them now and then when free to do 'soft learning' - whereby the objective is to just be aware of these concepts (no need to understand them fully).
