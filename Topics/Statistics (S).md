# Overview

Direction - The focus should be on:

* Some basic classical statistics
* Some regression
* Some time series
* Some Bayesian stats

# Classical Statistics 

This is the classical statistics route. The introductory text trio is **Wackerly, Mittelhammer, DeGroot**. These are the foundational mathematical stats books.

After that is **Hogg**, then **Casella** as the final boss. However, for quant, it seems like applied brainteasers are more important for interview knowledge than theory.

# Regression 

We have the good fundamentals books, Harrell and Montgomery. 

# Time Series 

We have some intro Python courses, **Zenhoko & Auffarth**. We have the basic theory - **Lambert, Hyndman**. The aim is to get a level of proficiency to read **Tsay** which is quant-applied.

# Probability

For practical probability, **Zhou & Crack** provide practice. The aim is to learn **Blitzstein** then apply the concepts on **Zhou & Crack** to solve problems.

# Bayesian Stats

**Lambert** then **Gelman**. For PGMs/Bayesian modelling in Python, after **Lambert** we can do **Louppe**.
