# Overview

Direction - The focus should be on:

* Deep learning fundamentals
* Deep learning for NLP

Other deep learning areas can be done after or concurrently the second based on need.

# Deep Learning Fundamentals

* Karpathy - Karpathy's awesome beginner playlist. Fundamentals using basic Torch to build strong intuition.
* Raschka/Persson/PyTorch Official - After Karpathy, we can branch out and do these 3 in parallel to strengthen foundations.

# Deep Learning for NLP

* CS224N - Good DL NLP theory.
* Transformers - We can use Von Werra & Huggingface course to learn to use Transformers library effectively. Can do concurrently with CS224N.

# Other Deep Learning Areas - CV, RL, GN

* LeCunn - Do this first.
* Computer Vision - CS231n, Ayyadevara
* Reinforcement Learning - CS234, Lapan, Sutton
* Graph Networks - CS224n
