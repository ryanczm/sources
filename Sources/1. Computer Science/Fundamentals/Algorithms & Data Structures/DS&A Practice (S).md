# Overview

This note aims to plan out a strategy for **doing data structures & algorithms questions tailored for data science/quant roles**. 

DS&A has much larger scale than other types of questions so **stratified sampling** must be used. 

**Leetcode (free)** has the most questions: ~3000. **Hackerrank (free)** has ~1000.

# Stratified

CTCI - 200 (By topic)
EPI - 220 (By topic)
HR 3M - 100 (By week)
G75 (LC) - 170 (By week)
N150 (LC) - 150 (By week)

# Syllabus

The plan is to do in a weekly fashion, then categorize (reconcile) every now and then. We will have a common question bank with categories. We will also have by week notes. 

1. Select source
2. Do temporally (either weekly) or in case of CTCI/EPI, do in chapter order.
3. For source notes, structure organically (by source or topic). 
4. Reconcile into common notes each time.

Order: (HR3M | G75 | CTCI) → EPI → LC/HR (Hard)

TODO:

1. Common note structure (find a source)
2. HR3M/G75 structure (up to W6)
3. CTCI structure (first 5 chapters).
