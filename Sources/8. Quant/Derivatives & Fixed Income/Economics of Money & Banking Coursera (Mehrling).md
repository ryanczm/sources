# Overview

A free Coursera course by Columbia University by Perry Mehrling (Economics professor at Boston University). Teaches on interest rates, money and banking, recommended by [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o3bla9/any_good_books_for_learning_about_central_banks/).

A very long course, it is 13 weeks of ~2h lectures each week.

May want to do this before attempting any financial economics questions in Crack.
